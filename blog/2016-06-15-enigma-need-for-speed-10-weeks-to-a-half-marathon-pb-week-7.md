- Friday -PM: Easy 12.2 mi
- Saturday - PM: 16 mi LSR (3 mile warm up + 4 x convoluted loops of East park getting faster each loop + 3 mile cool down)

Week 7 saw the start of my two highest mileage weeks before I begin the taper. The start of the week was all about easy mileage with one eye on Wednesday's race.

Talking of Wednesday it turned out to be a epic day which you can read about in my [Otley 10 race report](http://dlw.me.uk/2016/06/14/otley-10/), to summarise I'm still chasing a 10 mile PB but happy with the race and experience despite traffic and a 18 hour day.

On Thursday for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to do my clubs hill training, probably because I'm not normally in Hull on a Thursday for the club's session and because my wife was doing hills. Anyway I surprised myself by setting one of my best time for the first 15 minutes completing 9 reps in 14:35  - the really fast lads can do 10 therefore it gives me confidence that one day I might be able to crack 10 in 15 minutes. For the full session I covered 4.7 miles inside 25 minutes which isn't too shabby even if I do say so myself.

The next key session was Saturday afternoons progressive LSR, after a short warm up, I did loops of our local park getting progressively faster for each loop and even doing a 6:20 mi at one point before a good cool down. The timing of the run and the loops wasn't by chance but to replicate the 2.30pm start for my half marathon at Milton Keynes consisting of 3 and half loops of a park.

All in all a good week, another couple of them and I'll be very happy with my form going into the race.
