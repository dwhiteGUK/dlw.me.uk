The second of two 80 mile weeks, just fell short due to two races in one week but still as a solid weeks 75.5 miles training. Training as follow:

## Week 8 - 75.5 mi (9h 42m)

- Monday - PM:  Easy 7.8 mi
- Tuesday -
    - AM: Easy 5.7 mi XC
    - PM: 7.3 mi (2.2 warm up + 3.1 mi race + 1.9 cool down)
- Wednesday -
    - AM: Easy 6 recovery run
    - PM: 14.7 LSR
- Thursday -
    - AM: Easy 4.8
    - PM: 13.1 mi (2.1 mi warm up + 9 mi strength workout: 2 x 4 mi @ 6.30 pace with 1 mil+ 2 mi cool down)
- Friday -Rest
- Saturday - Easy 5 pre-race day
- Sunday - 10.9 mi (1.5 mi pre loosener: 2 hours before + 2 mi warm up + 6.2 mi race + 1 mi cool down)

Several key session if you include the two races which if they aren't target races then they are classed as very hard tempo efforts (although happy to get a pb or a good performance at least).

Tuesday was the return of the Phil Johnson 5k and after the [last race](http://dlw.me.uk/2016/05/11/phil-johnson-5k-series-race-1/) I was confident with more training that I'd hopefully pb. That was the case and a 18:19 during heavy training is very pleasing.

Another big day Wednesday before Thursdays reps which this week was only 2 as they were 4 miles long. With the aid of some music it was very pleasing to be abe to stick to the 6.30 average pace and finish very strong.

A couple of easy days so I was at least a little tapered before the Hull 10k hence packing the miles in at the start of the week. I'd have loved a sub 38 and knew I shoudl be low 38 at the very least. On a twisty course (somebody said there was over 60 turns) and cobbles I was pleased with a 38:05 showing (of course a small part of me wished I'd have been 6 seconds faster).

2 weeks, 1 5k PB, a season's best 10k (and second fastest ever) and over 150 miles means everything looks like it's going in the right direction. Now two weeks to taper, next week is 50 miles before a very low week in the run up to the half.
