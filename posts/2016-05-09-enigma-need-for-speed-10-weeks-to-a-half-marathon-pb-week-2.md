Before you know it week 2 has been and gone. Not loads to say as the training is similar to last week except for the addition of 6 mile road race in the form of "Summer League Race 2 - Sproatley 6"

### Week 2 - 67 mi (8h 36m)

- Monday - Easy 8 Cross Country
- Tuesday - PM: 6 mi hard (race) + 2 mi warm up and 0.9 mi cool down
- Wednesday - 12 mi midweek LSR
- Thursday - Rest day due to being Liverpool for work all day.
- Friday -
    - AM: Easy 4.2 mi recovery run
    - PM: Easy 10 mi
- Saturday - Strength workout - 11.4 mi (8 x 800m with 400m recovery + 3 mi warm up and 2.5 mi cool down)
- Sunday - 12 mi LSR

A really pleasing week. The race wasn't quite the pace I expected but still averaged a good 6.12 per mile (maybe went out too fast with a 5.46 first mile - it is downhill!).  The easy runs were all around 7.45 /mi pace which felt very comfortable, as it should, however it's still pleasing to know the strength in the legs is coming back.  Saturday's strength workout was a real killer, I did plan to do 10 reps but after 8 for a total of just under 6 miles I decided that it was best to call it a day.

Now looking forward to Tuesdays 5k race, fingers crossed I'm close to PB pace (and the wind abates a little).
