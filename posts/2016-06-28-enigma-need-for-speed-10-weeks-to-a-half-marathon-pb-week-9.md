The start of a two week taper period. This week reducing my mileage from just short of 80 to 50. Training as follows:

## Week 9 - 49.3 mi ( 6h 13m)

- Monday - PM:  Easy 5 mi
- Tuesday - PM: 10.8 mi (0.7 mi warm up + 9.4 tempo + 0.6 mi cool down)
- Wednesday - PM: 12.1 mi LSR
- Thursday - Rest Day
- Friday - AM: 11.3 (3 mi warm up + 5.9 mi - 8 x 800m with 400 m recovery + 2.3 mi cool down)
- Saturday - Easy 10 (Norfolk)
- Sunday - Rest Day

As it's taper time I'm no longer doing double days. Only two key sessions this week and a midweek LSR but none at the weekend as keeping mileage down plus I was at a party on the Saturday and in Liverpool all day Thursday hence 2 rest days.

The Tuesday session was super tough but happy to do just short of 10 only 2 days after a race at an average pace of 6:30.

Fridays intervals were a little slow for each 800m and it was a tough one but as it was midday in the heat I was still happy with the session overall.

Next week is race week so fingers crossed I'm on form come Saturday afternoon.
