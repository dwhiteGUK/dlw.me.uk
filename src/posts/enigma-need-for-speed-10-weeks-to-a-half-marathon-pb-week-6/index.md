This week was always going to be a rest week and with getting poorly the timing was perfect. However I did have two 10k races planned. Training as follow:

## Week 6 - 50.1 mi (6h 24m)

- Monday - Enforced rest
- Tuesday - PM: 8.5 mi (1.8 mi warm up + [10k race](http://dlw.me.uk/2016/06/06/summer-league-race-4-leven-10k/) + 0.4 mi cool)
- Wednesday - AM: Easy 5 recovery run
- Thursday - AM: Easy 6 pre work in Liverpool
- Friday -
- - AM: Easy 4
    - PM: Easy 7.7
- Saturday - PM: Easy 5 (pre race day)
- Sunday -
    - AM: 11 mi (1.9 mi warm up + [10k race](http://dlw.me.uk/2016/06/07/woodhall-spa-10k/) + 0.9 mi cool down)
    - PM: Easy 4.8 mi recovery run

Monday wasn't supposed to be a rest day but after cutting previous days long run short I was substantially under the weather Monday therefore thought it was best to take a rest day rather than the 8 miles easy I had planned.

Summer Leagues returned on Tuesday with gale force winds forecast for the day. They never materialised however the wind was particularly prevalent for the first  3 miles. To say I was off form is an understement, finishing  in over 40 minutes - the full write up is available in my [Leven 10k post](http://dlw.me.uk/2016/06/06/summer-league-race-4-leven-10k/).

After Tuesday I spent the rest of the week just getting the miles in. I was out in Liverpool Wednesday night anyway therefore training was always going to be curtailed somewhat.

Sunday was another 10k, this time [Woodhall Spa 10k](http://dlw.me.uk/2016/06/07/woodhall-spa-10k/), I wasn't feeling 100% but much better than I had at the start of the week. Hopefully I'd get a chance to redeem myself and set a better benchmark for the 10k. I wont go into too ,uch detail as you can read about it in my [report](http://dlw.me.uk/2016/06/07/woodhall-spa-10k/). However a sub 39 showing was more like it.

Not my greatest week due to recovering from a cough, however a solid week in the end and looking forward to next weeks 80+ mile week.
